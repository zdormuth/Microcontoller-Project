Motion detecting pet door opener

A Particle Wifi-enabled microcontroller is used to simulate a motion detecting pet door. The physical structure is not built yet. The microcontroller has a motion detector connected that triggers a flag when a certain amount of motion is detected for a specific amount of time. The microcontroller also includes a temperature reader that blocks the animal from going out under x amount of degrees and over y amount of degrees. The microcontroller also includes a light sensor that will prevent the animal from leaving when it is dark. The opening and closing of the door is determined by the temperature and light sensor data is and the stated conditions. The door can always be accessed from the outside if a specific amount of motion is detected. I designed this because my cats at home always want to go outside and it is nice to have an option to not have to physically be around to let them out. The next steps are to add a camera and notifications on the phone to physically unlock the door from a remote setting. This was experiemented using IFTTT but was found to be very inconsistent at the time.
